##Git branching simple guide
Working with branches is key to team development with git, but also has risks.
Keep your working pattern as simple as possible.
Avoid working on the same part of the code as your team-mates.
Agree on work to complete and communicate regularly.
Don’t leave hanging branches (apologies for the pun!).

##Check-up
git status check current repository status

##Creating a branch (from main)
git branch list branches
git branch “my_name” create a new branch with name “my_name”
git branch -d “my_name” delete the branch with name “my_name”

##Working in that branch
git checkout “my_name” move to the named branch
git commit Your commit commands now work in that branch
git push You must ‘push’ your work before attempting to merge

##Merging from your branch to main (must be in main first)
git checkout move to the main branch (the destination)
git pull update the main branch (your team may have made
changes)
git merge "my_name” merge the named branch into the main code
git branch -d "my_name” delete the branch once it is merged successfully
